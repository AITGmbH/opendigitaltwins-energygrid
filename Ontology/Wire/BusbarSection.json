        "comment": "A conductor, or group of conductors, with negligible impedance, that serve to connect other conducting equipment within a single substation. \nVoltage measurements are typically obtained from voltage transformers that are connected to busbar sections. A bus bar section may have many physical terminals but for analysis is modelled with exactly one logical terminal.",

## Substation 


In IEC 61968-13 all conducting equipment shall be a member of either a substation or of a feeder. Normally all substation equipment is housed in a physical enclosure such as a building or a fenced area. A feeder is generally outside a physical enclosure and consists of a collection, or connected set, of AC line segments, switches, transformers (which may or may not be considered as a substation), etc.

HV/LV Substation and LV/LV Substation can be modeled by following the same principles or by using the Type properties.

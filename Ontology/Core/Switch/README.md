## Switch

A generic device designed to close, or open, or both, one or more electric circuits. All switches are two terminal devices including grounding switches. IEC 61968-13 supports the following kinds of Switch devices:

- **Breaker** able to interrupt fault currents greater than normal load currents.

- **LoadBreakSwitch** able to interrupt normal load currents only.

- **Disconnector** no current interrupt capability.

- **Fuse** able to interrupt fault currents.

- **Jumper** and **GroundDisconnector**

IEC 61970-301 allows only two states for a switch device, i.e. open and closed. Thus for a 3-phase switch it suggests that all three phases of the switch always operate together and it does not support the situation where, for example, phase A of the switch is open while phases B and C are closed. Of course, a single-phase switch may be open or closed.

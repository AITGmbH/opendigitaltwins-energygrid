## CustomerLoad
An EnergyConsumer is a generic user of energy - a  point of consumption on the power system model. 
According to IEC 61968-13, a MV  customer is a **CustomerLoad** and a LV customer is an **EquivalentLoad**.

# EquivalentLoad 
According to IEC 61970-301, an EnergyConsumer is a generic user of energy - a  point of consumption on the power system model. According to IEC 61968-13, a LV customer is an EquivalentLoad.
An EquivalentLoad has the attribute customerCount having its value greater than one to indicate the number of customers attached. The voltage level is specified by a voltage level that contains this EquivalentLoad.

## ElectricVehicle
An electric vehicle (EV) is a vehicle that uses one or more electric motors or traction motors for propulsion. An electric vehicle may be powered through a collector system by electricity from off-vehicle sources, or may be self-contained with a battery, solar panels, fuel cells or an electric generator to convert fuel to electricity.
